# tendenci-base-theme
One base starter theme for a Tendenci site. This repo will replace the older "tendenci-project-template" repo.

## Using Bootstrap 3
Bootstrap Built-ins are used to create the foundation for most of the Tendenci modules in the theme.  Change the Bootswatch CDN in the base.html file to test completely different looks quickly while developing your new site.

To add customizations on select pages, add your own unique class or id to prevent affecting the Bootstrap built-ins in other modules.
